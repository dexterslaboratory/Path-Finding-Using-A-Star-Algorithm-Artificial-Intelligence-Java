# Path-Finding-Using-A-Star-Algorithm-Artificial-Intelligence-Java
Given a two dimensional matrix along with the source, the destination and the blocked cells the program returns the shortest path that can be taken.<br>

Sample Input:                             <br>
Enter the dimensions:                     <br>
3 4                                       <br>
Enter source:                             <br>
2                                         <br>
Enter destination:                        <br>
12                                        <br>  
Enter blocked cells separated by space:   <br>
11                                        <br>

Output:   <br>
2	0	2	3	  <br>
2	2	2	3	  <br>
6	6	0	7	  <br>
The path is: 12 <- 7<- 2    <br>
